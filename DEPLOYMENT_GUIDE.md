# Origami NFT Marketplace - Contract Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **QL1 Wallet with QOM tokens** for gas fees
2. **Private Key** from your wallet
3. **QOM Token Address** on QL1 chain
4. **Admin Budget Address** (your wallet address to receive platform fees)

## Environment Variables

You already have these set in your v0 project:

- `QL1_RPC_URL` - QL1 blockchain RPC endpoint (https://rpc.qom.one)
- `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your wallet's private key (KEEP SECRET!)
- `QOM_TOKEN_ADDRESS` - QOM token contract address on QL1 (0xa26dfBF98Dd1A32FAe56A3D2B2D60A8a41b0bDF0)
- `ADMIN_BUDGET_ADDRESS` - Address to receive platform fees (7% total: 3% buyer + 3% seller + 1% donation)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Compile Contracts

First, compile the Solidity contracts to check for errors:

\`\`\`bash
npm run compile:contracts
\`\`\`

This will:
- Compile `OrigamiNFT.sol`
- Compile `OrigamiMarketplace.sol`
- Generate contract ABIs in `contracts/artifacts/`

### Step 2: Deploy to QL1 Blockchain

Deploy both contracts to the QL1 chain:

\`\`\`bash
npm run deploy:contracts
\`\`\`

The deployment script will:
1. âœ… Verify you're connected to QL1 (Chain ID 766)
2. âœ… Check your wallet balance
3. âœ… Deploy OrigamiNFT contract
4. âœ… Deploy OrigamiMarketplace contract
5. âœ… Verify contract configuration
6. âœ… Save deployment info to `deployment-info.json`

### Step 3: Copy Contract Addresses

After successful deployment, you'll see output like:

\`\`\`bash
ðŸ“‹ Contract Addresses:
   OrigamiNFT: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
   OrigamiMarketplace: 0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Add Addresses to Environment Variables

Add these two environment variables to your v0 project:

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**
   - Copy the OrigamiNFT address from deployment output

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**
   - Copy the OrigamiMarketplace address from deployment output

## Verification

After deployment, verify your contracts on the QL1 block explorer:

- NFT Contract: `https://scan.qom.one/address/[NFT_ADDRESS]`
- Marketplace Contract: `https://scan.qom.one/address/[MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS]`

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
- Your wallet needs QOM tokens to pay for deployment gas fees
- Get QOM tokens from a QL1 faucet or exchange

### "Wrong network"
- Ensure `QL1_RPC_URL` is set to `https://rpc.qom.one`
- Check that you're connected to Chain ID 766

### "Invalid QOM_TOKEN_ADDRESS"
- Verify the QOM token address is correct for QL1 chain
- Check it's a valid Ethereum address format

### "Deployment failed"
- Check your private key is correct
- Ensure you have enough QOM for gas
- Verify RPC endpoint is accessible

## What Happens After Deployment?

Once deployed and environment variables are set:

1. âœ… Users can connect their wallets (MetaMask, etc.)
2. âœ… Users can mint origami NFTs
3. âœ… Users can list NFTs for sale
4. âœ… Users can buy NFTs with QOM tokens
5. âœ… Platform automatically collects 7% total fees (3% buyer + 3% seller + 1% donation)
6. âœ… Creators receive royalties (0-5%)

## Security Notes

- **NEVER share your PRIVATE_KEY**
- **NEVER commit .env files to git**
- The deployment script saves addresses to `deployment-info.json` for reference
- Keep this file safe - you'll need these addresses to interact with your contracts

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Test minting an NFT
2. Test listing an NFT for sale
3. Test buying an NFT
4. Verify commission payments to admin budget address
5. Check royalty payments to creators
